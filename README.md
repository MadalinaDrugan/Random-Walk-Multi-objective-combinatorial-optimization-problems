There are two test problems:
  1) multi-objective quadratic assignment problem, which is in the files containing "mQAP"
  2) multi-objective NK problem, which is in the files containing "MNK" 
  
The Mathematica files compute:
  1) the neighbourhood of one of the two problems, which are the files containing "neigh"
  2) numerical examples of computing the neighbourhood, which are the files containing "ex" or a number
  3) the graph Laplacian, which is the file containing "graphLaplacian"
